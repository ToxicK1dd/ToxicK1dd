# Hi, i'm baek üëã
A full-stack engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions.\
I specialize in finding solutions to problems, and have over 5 years of experience in IT.\
\
My journey in software development has led me to work on a variety of projects,\
ranging from small-scale applications to large, complex systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

I am currently the lead developer at a startup, where I wear multiple hats and strive to excel in each role.\
My responsibilities span across various aspects of software development, making every day a new adventure and a learning opportunity.\
\
I enjoy applying my skills to contribute to the growth and development of companies.\
My proficiency lies in web development, where I am skilled in using technologies like ASP.NET/C#, React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

## üìñ My history

My passion for technology started nearly a decade ago, with early experiments in website creation and server management.\
I also had good times changing things on my parents devices, and sometimes messing everything up, they were not likely as pleased.\
\
However, my formal coding journey began with my first internship at a tech startup.\
This was is where honed my skills in software development, and learned the ins and outs of startup culture.\
\
During this time, I massively contributed to the whole system,\
writing everything from backend, to frontend, and managing infrastructure.\
\
Unfortunately, the journey ended when investors withdrew funding.\
Despite this setback, my performance led to being chosen by my boss for a new venture.\
\
This subsequent project was both intense and rewarding, lasting 9 months.\
Now almost everything became my responsibility, going from a team of 6, to just me and my boss.\
\
The project unfortunately ended with the untimely demise of my boss. Which was a significant personal and professional blow.\
Following this, the project came to a halt when investors withdrew their support three months later, just as i had finished the MVP.\
\
Currently, I'm engaged in an exciting new project that shows great promise and resilience.\
This time with financial independence from investors, a milestone that speaks volumes about the project's potential and our team's capabilities.\
\
I'm again the lead of the venture, and deeply involved in all aspects of the project,\
applying my experience and expertise in building startups.\
The MVP is on track to be completed within a year, marking another significant achievement in my IT-journey.\
\
This journey has not only been about technical growth but also about adapting to change,\
overcoming adversity, and learning to lead under challenging circumstances.\
\
I look forward to continuing this path, contributing to meaningful projects,\
and embracing the ever-evolving landscape of technology, innovation and digital transformation.

## üéì Education

While I may not have a university degree, my educational experiences is defined by a unique blend of formal and self-directed learning.\
I completed a 3-year education in IT, which laid the foundation for my technical knowledge.

Beyond formal education, my real-world learning has been driven by hands-on experience in my own projects and working in startups.\
This practical approach has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of software development, and has been instrumental in honing my problem-solving and technical skills.\
\
My journey underscores the value of experiential learning and adaptability in the ever-changing landscape of technology.\
I believe that continuous learning, curiosity, and the ability to apply knowledge in practical scenarios,\
are just as important as formal education in building a successful career in tech.

## üíª Skills

Given enough time and the right challenge, I'm confident in my ability to become proficient in almost any technology.\
My broad skill set is a testament to my adaptability and strong foundational knowledge in software development.\
Here are some of the key programming languages, technologies, frameworks, and tools I've worked with:

### Programming Languages

My ability to quickly grasp new technologies is facilitated by my solid understanding of software fundamentals.\
This versatility allows me to adapt to new challenges and continuously expand my skill set in the ever-evolving world of technology.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

While my primary focus remains on my current role, where I dedicate most of my time and energy,\
